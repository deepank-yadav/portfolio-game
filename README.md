# ⚔️ Quest for the Code — Deepank Yadav's Portfolio

> A retro RPG-style interactive portfolio website built with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
> No frameworks. No build tools. Just open `index.html` and play.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
📂 portfolio/
 ├── index.html             →  HTML structure         (don't edit)
 ├── styles.css             →  All styling & animations (don't edit)
 ├── main.js                →  Game logic & live APIs  (don't edit)
 ├── portfolio-config.js    →  ✏️  YOUR DATA FILE — only edit this
 └── README.md              →  This file
```

> ⚠️ **All 4 files must stay in the same folder** for the site to work correctly.

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Download all 4 files into one folder
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. That's it — no installs, no npm, no build step needed

```bash
# Optional: serve with Python to avoid any CORS issues
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open → http://localhost:8080
```

## ✏️ How to Update Your Details

**You only ever need to edit one file: `portfolio-config.js`**
Everything else — the game, the layout, the API calls — updates automatically.

### 👤 Profile Info
```js
profile: {
  name:    "Deepank Yadav",
  title:   "Senior Software Engineer",
  company: "Adeptia Inc.",
  bio:     "Your updated bio here...",
  status:  "Open to Opportunities",   // shown as live status in Contact zone
  level:   "LVL 8 ENGINEER",          // shown in HUD top bar
}
```

---

### 📡 Social Links
```js
contact: {
  email:    "your@email.com",
  github:   "https://github.com/your-username",
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/your-handle",
  medium:   "https://medium.com/@your-handle",
  twitter:  "https://x.com/your-handle",
  twitch:   "",           // leave blank "" to hide
  website:  "",           // leave blank "" to hide
}
```

### 📬 Contact Form (Formspree)

The "Leave a Message" form is powered by **Formspree** and delivers messages directly to your email inbox.

**Current endpoint:**
```js
contact: {
  formspreeUrl: "https://formspree.io/f/mjgeoqor",
}
```

**To update the form endpoint in the future:**
1. Log in to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Go to your form → copy the new endpoint URL
3. Open `portfolio-config.js`
4. Replace the value of `formspreeUrl` with your new URL

```js
// Example — just change this one line:
formspreeUrl: "https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_NEW_ID",
```

**How it works:**
- Visitor fills in Name + Email + Message → clicks Send
- Form validates all fields + email format in browser
- Sends a `POST` request to your Formspree endpoint
- Message lands in your **Gmail inbox** (`deepankkyadav@gmail.com`)
- Visitor sees a success/failure dialog instantly — no page reload

**Formspree free plan:** 50 messages/month — perfect for a portfolio.
Upgrade at [formspree.io/pricing](https://formspree.io/pricing) if needed.

```js
profile: {
  mediumFollowers: "500+",  // ← update whenever you check
}
```

## ⚡ Live Data (Auto-Updates Every Visit)

These numbers are fetched **live every time someone opens your portfolio** — you never need to update them manually:

| Data | Source | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub repo count | `api.github.com` | Character, Projects, Achievements, Contact |
| GitHub followers | `api.github.com` | Character, Achievements, Contact |
| GitHub repo list | `api.github.com` | Projects zone (live repo cards) |
| Medium blog posts | Medium RSS via `rss2json.com` | Scroll Library zone |
| Blog post count | Medium RSS | World map card + Scroll Library |

**If GitHub or Medium is slow to load**, the zones show a `⏳` spinner and auto-update as soon as data arrives — no page refresh needed.
